= Needed Features =

 * Refactor the importer interface so that importers just return the message content and the framework sends it to the server
 * Paginate the message list page
 * Add a search feature (search at different levels (conversations with a specific user, a specific protocol, or globally))
 * Add support for importers to detect the last thing they sent (based on timestamp and host?)
 * Write an importer for Miranda
 * Write a README
  * Include instructions for setting up the website (or make it easier)
 * Write an importer for ICQ

= Maybe =

 * Write a plugin to view the logs from Adium
 * Add the ability to associate multiple accounts with a single person, and then browse all conversations with that person (regardless of the protocol used)
